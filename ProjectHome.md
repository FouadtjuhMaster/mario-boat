# Mario Boat #

Join Mario in this new boat adventure, travel across the seas, rivers and more in Mario Boat for the PSP, NDS & PC. This game will let you play some SEA-rious boat adventure!

There is a Mario Kart, there is a Mario Golf, there is a Mario Tennis.... But have you ever seen a Mario Boat? Well, I'll try my best to get one on the map! Since I'm a huge Mario fan, I'll enjoy myself!
